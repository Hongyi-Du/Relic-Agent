"""Historical issue stream for OSS time-machine substrates (brief §9).

Real historical issues are the experiment backbone. They are seeded as product issues at t0 (so the
org has concrete work) AND released over time as EXTERNAL community pressure that mirrors the
project's real timeline:

    historical issue  ->  external post / customer complaint  ->  internal feed  ->  ticket

Held-out issues are NEVER placed on the stream (they live only in evaluator assets), so they can't be
released during the capability-formation phase. The ticket-closure rule (§9.3) forbids closing an
issue/ticket on a stale patch — it requires post-issue work AND passing test evidence.
