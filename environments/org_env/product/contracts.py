"""Product Contract Graph (v13 P2) — the cross-module interface contract as a FIRST-CLASS object.

v12's failure was not "no evidence protocol" but "no interface-contract governance": each
module got locally better, yet `Claim / Source / ResearchResult / Eval / Report / Smoke` drifted
out of agreement, so the product stopped running end-to-end (research_loop passed a dict where
ClaimTracker.add expected text+source_ids). This module makes the producer/consumer schema
explicit + classifiable, so an integration break is caught at CI/PR time (does the product still
RUN end-to-end) — distinct from the release gate's quality bar (is the product good enough).
