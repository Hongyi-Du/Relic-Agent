"""The callable surface a product publishes, for whoever is writing the code.

A pack can hand the organization a contract document -- the exact class names,
method names and signatures a fixed test suite will import. mini_blobstore ships
one at knowledge/public_api.md, 3751 characters naming every symbol its five
steps are scored on.

Nothing ever showed it to the model writing the code. The code editor's prompt
carried the file's current text, the current build error, the symbols other
modules already import, and the organization's own adopted rules -- and not one
character of the contract. `review_doc` was offered to a single role and only for
the first document it could see, so no engineer had a way to read it either. Over
96 ticks the artifact was touched zero times.

So the names were guessed and then corrected by collision: UploadConflict for
UploadConflictError, ReplicaSet for ReplicaStatus, GCPlan never written at all,
and ReplicaStatus.__init__ taking *args where the contract names object_id and
states. Every arm missed, by 5 names to 17 -- which measures how many times each
happened to run the gate, not what any of them could do.
