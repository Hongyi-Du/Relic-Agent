"""PolicyActionAttractorGuard (v4 §3).

v3 showed that repeated "safe" actions (audit_readme_claims / monitor_customer_feedback /
create_doc / edit_repo_file) are not just an LLM-prompt problem — they are a *policy
attractor*: the LLM proposes a plausible action, the policy scores it high, the validator
passes it, task progress rewards it, the product gap remains, so the same action looks
attractive again. This module breaks the loop two ways:

  * hard masks   — remove a candidate from the choice set entirely (cooldown, awaiting
                   review, nothing new to monitor, task already done, doc already exists);
  * soft penalties — down-weight low-marginal-value actions in the utility so the policy
                   prefers actions with real marginal contribution.

It also produces a top-k policy trace so we can tell LLM-repetition from a scoring
attractor from a validator-fallback attractor.
