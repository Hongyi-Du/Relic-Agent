"""OrgPolicy — B3 profile selection plus the explicit no-LLM test fallback.

utility(candidate) = Σ_feature  weight(agent, feature) · feature_value
weight(agent, f)   = BASE_WEIGHT[f] + Σ_trait profile_or_skill[trait]·COEFF[trait,f]
                     (with global budget-pressure + self-state modulation)

In B3 the persona therefore *actually* changes the chosen action (O1 §2 #10): Calvin
up-weights review/reproducibility/protocol-use; Sean up-weights progress/demo and
discounts review; Scarlett up-weights external/customer; Will up-weights
review/claim-evidence; etc. B0/B1/B2 do not call ``select`` when an LLM client is
available. Their client-free test path sets ``use_profile_conditioning=False``
and uses deterministic argmax. Scoring modes:
  * mock  — deterministic seeded softmax over utilities (no LLM; for CI/smoke)
  * pcbsp — same scorer; hook left for an LLM candidate/rationale layer (O2)
