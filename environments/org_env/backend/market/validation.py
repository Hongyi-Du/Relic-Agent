"""Market-validation loop (v14 P5).

``run_market_trials`` is called after a release is published (and when an agent
collects post-launch feedback). It spawns a small burst of simulated external users
who evaluate the *current published product* and leave a market signal:

    real product quality  ->  trial satisfaction  ->  conversion + willingness-to-pay
                                                   ->  CustomerTicket (+ cust_issue if they churn)
                                                   ->  external_signal_event/customer_trial
                                                   ->  feedback episode  ->  (org fixes it) -> product change

The satisfaction/WTP are DERIVED FROM the four-layer readiness (runtime_ready is the
dominant factor) so the market cannot be won by a product that does not actually run
and ground its claims. ``market_summary`` turns the accumulated trials into the
``customers`` funding-milestone score (paying conversions + WTP, NOT raw ticket count,
so churned/complaint tickets can't game the milestone).
