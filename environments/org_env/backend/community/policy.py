"""OrgEnv external community — lightweight agents + controlled-intervention policy
(DESIGN env_org §33.3 / §34).

External agents do NOT run the full lived loop. They (a) hold a frozen seed corpus, and (b) react
to *controlled interventions* (API price shock / customer complaints / competitor launch / expert
criticism / investor pressure) by emitting new public Posts + MarketSignals. Internal company
agents only feel this pressure if they actively `read_feed` / `search_posts` / `monitor_customer_
feedback` (no omniscient injection) — which is how external sentiment/demand reaches internal
decisions (the §34 golden chain: external pressure -> perception -> budget/wish/protocol).
