"""Where a change lives from the moment it is made: task -> branch -> PR.

The simulator used to keep every accepted patch in one pool per agent and work
out afterwards which branch each belonged on. Nothing in Git does that, and the
guessing is where the delivery layer kept breaking:

  * an author had one long-lived branch, so opening a request took it out of
    reach and every later change joined the one request -- 17 commits and all
    five modules on one branch, green only when everything in it was right;
  * letting a repair join somebody else's red request rebuilt the same magnet
    from the other side, 11 of 11 commits into one request while four others
    went untouched for 56 to 100 ticks;
  * a request opened on one module was refused six times over for the same
    named symbol, and the fix, when it came, was committed together with an
    unrelated new module because commit took everything in hand at once. The
    verdict stopped naming a symbol and the clue was gone.

None of those are things an author did. They are what a routing layer does when
it has to infer what the author meant.

Here a patch belongs to a branch when it is made, because the work item it is
for is known then: the task it advances, or the module it changes when no task
claims it. A commit takes what is pending on its branch. A request is that
branch. A repair is a commit on the branch whose request is red -- which needs
no rule, since that is where the work already is.
