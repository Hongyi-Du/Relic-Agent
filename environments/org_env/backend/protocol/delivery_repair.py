"""Repair the packaging, not just the rule, when a gate walls off finished work.

The policy-repair path can only ease the rule a merge-evidence gate enforces,
and easing it does not move the work. On a tg_automation B3 arm the desk held
correct fixes for four contracts while the mainline carried one: each fix rode
in a branch or a fat pull request whose other, unfinished surfaces kept the
whole request red, so nothing merged after t47 while the same rule was flagged
harmful and relaxed six times over three hundred ticks. Relaxing it enough to
let those requests through would have landed the unfinished surfaces too.

The repair the situation needs is to the packaging. A member who found correct
work stuck behind unrelated stubs would split it out: open a clean request
carrying only the desk's version of one issue's file, check it against that
issue's own gate, and land it when it is green. That is what this does, and it
only fires when the organization's own adopted rule is what is blocking
delivery -- so it is the delivery half of policy repair, not a way around the
gate. Work is landed only when its issue-scoped CI passes; a red repackage is
left as a red request, never forced.
