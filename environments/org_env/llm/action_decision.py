    The coding affordance deals a few modules per agent per tick and rotates
    which ones, so over a run every module with an open issue comes up. But an
    agent reads the issue list, not the rotation, and names the module the
    issue actually points at. When those disagree the decision used to be
    thrown away whole: on the pilot one engineer named typeutils.py correctly
    eight times across 238 ticks and was refused every time, while the file sat
    in the queue behind three others.

    So a named target is accepted when it is a real code module that a
    currently open coding issue points at — the same test the affordance
    applies — and refused otherwise. This admits no target the affordance would
    not eventually have dealt; it only stops making the agent guess the tick.
