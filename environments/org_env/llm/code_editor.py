# output that no longer exists.
#
# The old 48k was calibrated on "the largest file in a real starter repo
# measured 15.6k characters". Measured across the twelve packs in the matrix,
# that is wrong by a factor of six: ten of them contain source above 48k, and
# it is core module code, not vendored blobs -- anyio's asyncio backend at 99k,
# celery's canvas at 97k, black's trans at 95k, aiohttp's connector at 69k. On
# boltons the ceiling made two of the twelve seeded issues unfixable by
# construction: both name iterutils.py at 56k, and one run opened 62 patches
# against them, every one declined before the model was asked anything.
#
# What is left is a physical bound, not a judgement about how much an
# organization should attempt: a file has to fit the model's context window.
# Unlike the output cap and the shrink floor, removing it does not hand the
# decision back to the organization — it hands back a provider error, retried
# five times, recorded as an LLM failure. black ships generated profiling
# fixtures from 160k to 1.4M; the largest is roughly 350k tokens of input.

# for a model that can take it, matching UNCAPPED_OUTPUT in client.py.
