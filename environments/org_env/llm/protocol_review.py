"""Check a finished change against the rules the organization adopted for itself.

An institution that only exists as a registry row and a counter cannot be told
apart from one that governs the work. Measured on a five-step Pack: an arm adopted
"any change to a module other code depends on must preserve its callable surface —
names and each function's parameter names in order — exactly as the published
interface declares it", carried it for a hundred ticks with seven of nine members
supporting it and 118 recorded enforcements, and wrote code that dropped a
required class, renamed a public method to a private one and left out a declared
parameter. The rule was never in front of anyone writing code: the editor's prompt
had no notion of a protocol, and the decision context named the protocol by id
without its text.

So the rules travel to the editor before it writes, and one review reads the
finished change against them. This is the organization's own quality control
rather than the environment's: with nothing adopted there is nothing to check,
which is what makes an arm that institutionalizes differ from one that does not.
