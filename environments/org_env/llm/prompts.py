# A prompt carries the whole of its context. There used to be a 6000-character
# cut here, and on a B3 world at t336 it was dropping a median of 10217 of the
# 16217 a reflection had: product_context ran to character 7210 and everything
# after it — the agent's own recent actions, its recent failures, the needs it
# had not met, the conversation it had been part of — reached the model in none
# of the reflections that were built to reason over them. The reflection was
# reading one field and calling it the situation.
#
# No bound replaces it. The only bound that matters is the model's own context
# window, and the API says so plainly when a prompt exceeds it, where a silent
# cut says nothing at all. ORG_LLM_CONTEXT_CHARS is here for that case alone and
# is off unless set.
