"""ReflectionManager — episode/event pressure -> agent reflection -> wishes.

Reflection generation is template-based by default (deterministic, LLM-free) and
optionally LLM-driven when ``world.text_engine`` is present (mirrors the text-layer
pattern). Every reflection is written into long-term ``AgentMemory``, an
``AgentLogEntry`` trace, the world event log + event graph, and linked back to its
episode; wishes are EXTRACTED from the reflection's improvement ideas (never
invented) and keep ``source_reflection_id`` + ``raw_reflection_excerpt``.

Generic only — keyed by role / episode-type / need-type / work-state, never by a
specific agent id.
