"""Organization baselines for the controlled SocioGenesis experiment.

The baseline axis is independent from the OSS substrate/control axis:

* B0: one generalist founder with aggregate roster skills and the same company
  budget/tool surface. A traditional LLM chooses WHAT action to take.
* B1: an eight-person persistent role-based organization with flat role/skill
  prompts; profile coefficients, institutionalization and growth are disabled.
  A traditional LLM chooses WHAT action to take.
* B2: the same eight people, now selecting through a policy instead of letting
  the model name the next action — candidates are scored, prioritized and
  routed — with that scoring conditioned on profiles, plus individual growth.
  Still no institutions: they cannot turn a practice into a rule that outlives
  the moment.
* B3: B2 plus institutionalization. The reflection-to-proposal-to-adoption-to-
  persistence chain runs, which is what capability formation means here.

The ladder is arranged so its headline step varies one field. B1 to B2 is the
policy-mediation step and changes three (selection mode, profile conditioning,
growth): a policy that scores candidates needs weights, and a profile is what
those weights are made of, so the parts do not come apart here.

That makes B2 minus B1 an estimate of mediated action selection, not of
professional profiles. Reporting it as a profile effect overstates what the arm
manipulates — the model stops choosing the action at all. Isolating the profile
would need a further arm with B2's architecture, candidate pool and LLM call
path, differing only in role-agnostic versus profile-conditioned weights.

B2 to B3 changes ``institutionalization_enabled`` alone, so the capability
formation contrast is single-factor and can be reported as one.

Reflection sits deliberately on the institutionalization switch rather than on
its own: the chain that produces an institution begins with an agent reflecting
on what went wrong, so reflection is part of the mechanism under test, not a
confound riding alongside it.

The eight-person temporary team, which reset member-local state at each sprint
boundary, was a rung until it produced almost nothing distinguishable from B0
across a full pilot. It is now an overlay any condition can carry
(``temporary_team`` scenario parameter or ``ORG_TEMPORARY_TEAM``), so the
persistence claim stays testable without spending a rung on it.

Profile manipulations (homogeneous, role-only, shuffled, random) are NOT
organization conditions. They are post-formation intervention arms and
counterfactual-analysis transforms, and live in
``environments.org_env.experiments.persona_transforms``.

The module is deliberately independent from OSS datasets so baseline work cannot
mutate or specialize against Gitingest.
