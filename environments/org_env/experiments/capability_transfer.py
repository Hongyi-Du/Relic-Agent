"""Cross-repository capability transfer (protocol §54-§59, TRANSFER_ARMS).

A capability formed in a source repository is carried into a target repository,
and each arm is a COMPLETE target run from the frozen initial snapshot at
episode one. The source contributes three things and nothing else: the
capability bundle, the original roster's member state, and the provenance that
binds one to the other. The target's own B3 main run is the fresh-from-scratch
reference, so there is no blank arm.

The four arms are a 2x2 over what is inherited:

                      executable            removed / text-only
    retained roster   R_Exec                R_Removed
    fresh roster      F_Exec                F_Text

which isolates: what the capability objects contribute with the people held
constant (R_Exec vs R_Removed), what they contribute without the people
(F_Exec vs the reference), what the people contribute with the capabilities
held constant (R_Exec vs F_Exec), and whether the capability has to be
executable or whether matched prose is enough (F_Exec vs F_Text).

F_Text is the arm the design exists to make possible, and it is also the one
that can defeat itself: prose describing a rule is exactly the input an
organization needs to re-derive the rule. Capability compilation is therefore
frozen for the first TRANSFER_EVALUATION_WINDOW_EPISODES episodes, in the
reference too, so the window measures USING an inherited capability rather than
forming a new one.
